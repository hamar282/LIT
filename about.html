			<p>* LifeInUK Practice has been created to help you <b>pass</b> the Life in the UK Test. We have the experience of having undertaken and successfully passed the UK citizenship test ourselves. Here we have gathered numerous questions that cover the contents of the official <b>‘Life in the United Kingdom: A guide for new residents’ 3rd edition Handbook</b>, used for the 2020 citizenship test (and valid for the 2021 Life in the UK Test) and that will get you ready for the official test.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>* We strive to keep the information presented here free and as up-to-date as possible to get you prepared for the official test with confidence. We though it was important to offer the option to practice for the test by chapter, so you can assess the knowledge you have gained at the same time as you read the book. Also, we created tests that simulate the real test with questions that cover the entire handbook, the same timing as the exam and with the option to mark the questions you are unsure of to review or respond them at the end.
			</p>
			<br>	
			<p>* Many of the questions here have been asked in the <b>official test</b>, although the incorrect answers may vary in some cases. We try to collect questions that have been recently asked in the official citizenship test and we always appreciate candidate’s input. So, if you are going to take the exam soon or you have taken it recently please email us and share it by contacting us so future candidates get a better experience.
